Inventory Tetris was designed, programmed, and generally slapped together by Matthew "Gangles" Gallant. I am currently a software engineering undergrad in Montreal, Canada. You can find more of my work at http://gangles.ca/

Thanks to Anders Ruud, Michael Enger and Tommy Nguyen for making the LÃ–VE engine, Dan Bruno for introducing me to it, and everyone in #GBConfab@freenode.net for the moral support. Enjoy my silly game!
